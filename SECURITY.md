Community Standards for Xbox
We built Xbox for people like you—for players from all walks of life, everywhere in the world, who all want the same thing: a place to play and have fun. We need your help keeping the Xbox community safe and fun for everyone.

While the Code of Conduct section of the Microsoft Services Agreement applies to all Microsoft products, Xbox offers so many ways to interact with others that it benefits from an additional level of explanation.

To this end, we’ve created the following community standards for Xbox. Consider these standards a roadmap for contributing to this incredible, globe-spanning community. Remember: the Xbox community is yours. We all bring something unique, and that uniqueness is worth protecting.

Whether you’re brand new to gaming or have been playing for decades, we need you to be stewards of this place, to protect each other even as you compete. Because when everyone plays, we all win.

Our Shared Values
The spirit of Xbox lives in our values, which are key to sustaining a vibrant and welcoming community. Living these values every time we play shows the world the unifying power of gaming.

Gaming can be enjoyed by all
Creativity powers community
Competition is best when it’s fair
Helping others makes all of us stronger
Hate has no place here
Conduct
Some parts of the internet don’t have rules—and the Xbox community isn’t one of them. Yes, Xbox is, in a meaningful sense, your gaming network. But it belongs to millions of others, too. You deserve a place to be yourself with confidence, free from bullying, hatred, and harassment—and so does every other player. So it’s important to treat others as they would like to be treated.

Remember:

Win or lose, be a good sport
Did someone have a great game? Let them know!
You are the community
A little bit of trash talk is okay, but keep it clean
No one likes trolling, so don’t do it
Content
The gamertags, gamerpics, screenshots, game clips, and other posts you make with Xbox can be a great way to show off what’s meaningful to you. We encourage all players to be themselves and show off what they like, what makes them laugh, or what makes them amazing. But this sharing can’t come at the expense of other players’ positive experiences.

Remember:

Use your skills and creativity to add informative, helpful, funny, or interesting content that contributes positively to our vibrant and diverse community
Content you post needs to suit a wide audience
Context is important, and mature content that makes sense in a game might not be appropriate elsewhere in the Xbox community
Not everyone has the same likes or dislikes as you, so think twice about saying something hurtful about someone else’s content, playing style, or choices
Attitude
Helping others makes us all stronger. If you want to be a superstar and live our shared values, here are ways to go the extra mile:

Help others have great gaming experiences by joining the Xbox Ambassadors
Know a great community leader? Nominate them for the Xbox MVP Award
Hang with likeminded players by joining clubs
Make new friends by creating Looking for Groups to team with others in your favorite game
If you experience or witness inappropriate content or behavior, we encourage you to mute, block, and report the player(s) acting inappropriately
Cross-Platform Play
At Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo, we believe video games are a unifying force for the world. Cross-platform play empowers players across platforms to take part in a connected community that spans the globe, and no matter where you play we welcome you to join. As we come together, remember we’re all gamers, and we all have a role in helping others level up:

Remember:

Be a positive ambassador for your platform
Welcome all players to foster healthy cross-platform competition
Passion for your platform is great, but respect where others play
Be considerate. Every player is here to have fun!
Standards
If you've seen the Microsoft Services Agreement, the following rules probably look familiar. They may sound a bit like legalese, but bear with us—upholding these standards is critical to maintaining a community where everyone can have fun! People differ about what seems fun, and conflicts sometimes occur. But while plenty of conflicts can be worked out between players, there are nevertheless some things we just can’t tolerate.

In each section you’ll find examples showing how the Microsoft Services Agreement’s Code of Conduct relates to Xbox.

i. Keep it legal
Xbox is available in countries all over the world, and it’s important that people of all backgrounds feel safe and comfortable on our platform. To help ensure this, we must respect local laws and remove content or behavior that advocates or promotes illegal activities.


For example, don’t:

ii. Do your part to keep everyone safe
To keep Xbox a place where everyone can have fun, we can’t allow behavior or content designed to exploit, harm, or threaten anyone – children, adults, or otherwise. When threatening, abusive, or insulting language is used against another member of our community, or the community at large, it undermines every player’s ability to enjoy themselves.


For example, don’t:

iii. Turn that spam into substance
It’s great to be excited about growing your popularity and sharing all the cool things you do with Xbox. The best way to do that is by producing amazing content—not through giveaways, asking for likes and followers, or other inauthentic behavior. The best way to gain a following is by being yourself and creating awesome content that’s uniquely yours. Remember, creativity powers community.


For example, don’t:

iv. Keep your content clean
People enjoy all shapes and styles of content with Xbox. Everyone’s tastes are different, and that’s great! However, that doesn’t mean that absolutely anything goes. To keep the Xbox community welcoming and inclusive for everyone, some content must be avoided.

Support a welcoming and inclusive community

Harassment and hate take many forms, but none have a home here. To make the Xbox community a place where everyone can hang out, and to prevent people from feeling uncomfortable or unwelcome, we all need to be stewards. This means more than just not harassing other players—it means embracing them. It means saving those unsavory jokes for people you know will enjoy them. It means taking particular care for others while you play, keeping in mind how they might interpret your content.


For example, don’t:

Know the difference between trash talk and harassment

We get it—gaming can be competitive and interactions with other players can get heated. A little trash talk is an expected part of competitive multiplayer action, and that’s not a bad thing. But hate has no place here, and what’s not okay is when that trash talk turns into harassment.

Trash talk includes any lighthearted banter or bragging that focuses on the game at hand and encourages healthy competition. Harassment includes any negative behavior that’s personalized, disruptive, or likely to make someone feel unwelcome or unsafe. To qualify as harassment, the behavior doesn’t have to be drawn-out or persistent. Even a single abusive message could harm someone’s experience. Know when to draw the line, when to back off. Know and respect the other player.


For example:

Be yourself, but not at the expense of others

The Xbox community is yours, but it’s everyone else’s too. We encourage showing off what makes you unique and awesome, but it’s not cool to post something that keeps others from having positive experiences. We aspire to a community where gaming can be enjoyed by all. Problematic content just gets in the way. If you’re looking for a place on the internet to be overly edgy or get that rise out of people, Xbox isn’t the place for you.


For example, don’t:

Make stuff that’s suitable for all audiences

People from all over the world play with Xbox, and we understand that people from different backgrounds have diverse perspectives about mature and adult topics. But because the Xbox community must be friendly and accessible to everyone, this isn't the appropriate place for sexual content. Keep your posts and messages suitable for all audiences to help keep this a welcoming place for all.


For example, don’t:

They’ll see what you did there

Sometimes something seemingly harmless can actually reference something inappropriate, when looked at a certain way. Everyone appreciates a good joke, but if your content is designed to trick others into thinking they’re reading or seeing something inappropriate, we’ll have to treat it that way.


For example, don’t:

v. Fraud benefits no one
Fraud is any attempt to use deceit or misrepresentation for personal or financial gain. When players commit fraud against Xbox, it circumvents the processes that keep things fair for everyone, and ends up making games, add-ons, and subscriptions more expensive for everyone. This also applies to trying to make money through Xbox in unapproved ways, since doing so bypasses safeguards that exist to help keep everyone safe and financially secure.


For example, don’t:

vi. Where there are limits, there’s a reason
It’s never fun to lose access to Xbox features, but know that when we put restrictions in place, we do so to help ensure everyone’s safety or improve an experience for the community. Attempting to circumvent restrictions can affect both customer privacy and the integrity of Microsoft or partner services. For the safety of all, it’s important to respect deliberate limitations.


For example, don’t:

vii. Harmful behavior has no place on Xbox
Cheating, tampering, and the use of exploits

Since competition is best when it’s fair, a level playing field is one of the most important requirements for gaming. When people cheat, use exploits, or otherwise tamper with hardware or software to gain a competitive advantage, it ruins the experience for everyone. Because of this, cheating, tampering, and the use of exploits is never acceptable in the Xbox community. Like, never.


For example, don’t:

Piracy and unauthorized use

Pirating software is not a victimless crime—it robs game providers of revenue that funds games and add-ons that people want to play. Accessing or using content in inappropriate ways can contribute to fraud and spoil great experiences for other players, sapping the magic of Xbox. By using games and game content only in the ways intended, you help maintain a vibrant community for content creators and fellow players alike.


For example, don’t:

Damaging Microsoft, Xbox, or its customers

Manipulation, exploitation, and abuse of Xbox services doesn’t just affect Microsoft. These actions also inhibit the ability of Microsoft to provide the best possible services to customers around the world. At Xbox, we’re dedicated to the safety and well-being of our community, and we’re committed to ensuring that the products, features, and services our customers enjoy are safe, secure, and fun for everyone.


For example, don’t:

viii. Respect the rights of others
Essentially, this means don’t use things that don’t belong to you and don’t do things you don’t have permission to do. People work hard to make screen shots, game clips, and other content that’s enjoyed by millions of people. It’s important to let content creators unveil and share what they create on their terms. If you’re not sure if it’s okay to use something, it’s better to be safe and assume that using someone’s content is not okay.


For example, don’t:

ix. Always respect the privacy of others
Microsoft runs on trust, and it’s critical that we protect the privacy of our customers. We take this responsibility seriously, and we won’t tolerate behavior or content that puts the privacy or security of another player at risk.


For example, don’t:

x. Be a force for good, even when others aren’t
Sometimes, helping others break rules is just as harmful as breaking rules yourself. If you know that someone is engaging in behavior or dispersing content that violates these community standards, let them know that their behavior is not okay, and caution them rather than help them walk the road they’re on.


For example, don’t:

Consequences
Our priority is the safety of everyone in the Xbox community. Content and behavior that puts players at risk or makes them feel unwelcome has no place here. So, sometimes we need to step in. We're not out to punish, but rather to protect everyone's experience.

Every suspension or other corrective action aims only to show what was wrong and what can be learned from a situation. When suspensions end, we welcome players back so they can contribute to the Xbox community in positive ways. We know people make mistakes, and we believe lapses in judgment can be significant opportunities for growth.

Inappropriate conduct

If you violate Xbox community standards, you may find restrictions placed on your profile and/or device. When we suspend an Xbox profile, we restrict access to features that are most closely associated with the problematic behavior. Most commonly, this means a temporary suspension that removes one or more features for a period of time. Temporary suspensions can include:

Restrictions on the use of online multiplayer gaming
Removal of the ability to send text and voice messages
Blocking real-time voice and text communications
Preventing the broadcast of live game play
Restrictions on the use of parties and clubs
Inappropriate content

Since Xbox content must be appropriate for all audiences, sometimes we remove content to protect our customers. Depending on the type of content violation, this can result in our restricting certain features for the profile that created or shared the content. Temporary suspensions can include:

Blocks on the ability to upload game clips and screenshots
Restrictions on uploading or sharing Kinect content
Removal of inappropriate content from Xbox
Automatic assignment of a new gamertag
Limits on the ability to share Xbox content on other social networks
Removal of the ability to edit your Xbox profile or clubs
Repeat or severe offenses

We may permanently suspend a profile or device if we can no longer trust it due to a severe violation, or if our attempts to correct repeated negative behaviors are unsuccessful. Under permanent suspension, the owner of the suspended profile forfeits all licenses for games and other content, Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass membership time, and Microsoft account balances.
